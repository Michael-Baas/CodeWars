// What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

// addLength('apple ban') => ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
// addLength('you will win') => ["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
//
//Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.
//
// P: Parameters - strings that will have at least one element and
// words are separated by space 
// R: Returns - word with length added
// E: Examples -  addLength('apple ban') => ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
// P: Pseudocode - Loop through array, check each index's length then append that length it to the end of the index's string
